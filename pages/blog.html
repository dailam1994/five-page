            <h2>Amanada & Her Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Amanda B Cormer and I'm the owner of ABC Opticals, and I'd like 
                to briefly introduce you to who we are. I'm an optometrist with 20 years’ 
                experience, having worked for independents and chain stores both here and in 
                London. It was in London that I gravitated to the groovy, high end of the market 
                and returned to Brisbane 9 years ago with a new concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over years of working for others, what struck me was either mediocre eyewear, 
                outdated testing equipment in the back room, or both. ABC Opticals brings together 
                the world’s finest and funkiest eyewear designers, coupled with state of the art 
                equipment to make the eye examination a very civilised affair.
            </p>
            <p>
                We enjoy selling quality products, and most importantly, we enjoy finding the right 
                frame for the right person. That's what we do and we do it well. We don't sell 
                eyewear over the net, so visit us in person. We're worth the effort and your eyes 
                should be too. Finally, we believe that children should be treated as special people 
                so all our staff will make the experience at ABC Opticals the best we can for your 
                child. 
            </p>
